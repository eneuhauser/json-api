title: "JSON API: Specification Status"
---

**The JSON API specification has reached version 1.0.**

The [base specification](/format/) should be considered stable. It will
remain backwards compatible using a _never remove, only add_ strategy.

Some work related to this specification, such as [extensions](/extensions/),
is still experimental and should be considered a work in progress.

This entire site, including the specification itself, is managed at JSON
API's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/json-api/json-api). Please feel
free to suggest changes or let us know if you write an implementation by filing
an issue or pull request.
